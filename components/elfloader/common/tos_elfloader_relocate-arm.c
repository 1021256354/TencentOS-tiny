 - S (when used on its own) is the address of the symbol.
 - A is the addend for the relocation.
 - P is the address of the place being relocated (derived from r_offset).
 - Pa is the adjusted address of the place being relocated, defined as (P & 0xFFFFFFFC).
 - T is 1 if the target symbol S has type STT_FUNC and the symbol addresses a Thumb instruction; it is 0
otherwise.
 - B(S) is the addressing origin of the output segment defining the symbol S. The origin is not required to be the
base address of the segment. This value must always be word-aligned.
 - GOT_ORG is the addressing origin of the Global Offset Table (the indirection table for imported data
addresses). This value must always be word-aligned. See ยง4.6.1.8, Proxy generating relocations.
 - GOT(S) is the address of the GOT entry for the symbol S.
